This will hold the basic things I learn about machine learning and for many of the key terms I will give a short description
and then I will make a seperate file for more in depth research about those topics. 

Machine learning is how a computer can be utlized using algorithms and methods to help a computer learn and complete one or more tasks. 
It is sometimes confused with artificial intellegence. Machine learning is considered a part of artificial intellegence in some aspects
and artificial intellegence can be also considered a part of machine learning.
artificial intellegence is different than machine learning in that it interacts with the environment and learns based on input, whereas 
machine learning is giving a computer sample information that it can use to train and then complete a task.

machine learning waas the first idea for making a way for computers to learn. however, as artificial intellegence became more popular
machine learning also grew. As more research was done on artificial intellence more methods were invented such as neural networks
, inductive logic programming, and back propogation.
